  <h1>Using APIs and Databases</h1>
  <br />
  <p>
    I created two tables within one database which allows for me to show
    different functions of what we could do with an API. For the most part,
    you'll be able to interact with web forms to insert, update, and delete
    items in the students table. While the testimonials table is more to display
    functions within Python and using custom CSS for a particular testimonial.
    Feel free to browse the APIs and have a look at the JSON data.
