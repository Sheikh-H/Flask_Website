  <h1>Flask Website Project</h1>
  <br />
  <p>Welcome to my Flask website project.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This project is my second iteration of the final assignment from the
    <strong>30 Days of Python</strong> course by
    <strong>Asabeneh Yetayeh</strong>. I chose to rebuild the application to
    strengthen my understanding of Flask, backend logic, and full-stack
    development. Reworking the project allowed me to refine both the codebase
    and the overall user experience.
