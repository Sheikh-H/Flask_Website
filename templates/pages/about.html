  <h2>What This Project Includes</h2>
  <br />
  <p>
    One of the core features is a <strong>Text Analyzer tool</strong>. Users can
    enter a phrase or passage, and the application analyzes the text to provide
    useful insights, including word count, word frequency, the most frequently
    used word, and its percentage ratio. This feature is implemented using a
    simple HTML form and server-side processing.<br /><br />The project also
    integrates a <strong>MongoDB NoSQL database</strong> using a free-tier
    setup. Through this integration, the website can interact directly with the
    database, allowing data to be added, updated, and deleted via backend
    functions. In addition, the site includes a
    <strong>review system</strong> where visitors can submit feedback.<br /><br />Each
    review is classified as positive or negative based on the emoji provided.
    This classification dynamically affects how the review is displayed through
    CSS styling and contributes to a dashboard that summarizes review activity,
    including the number of positive and negative submissions.

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <br />
  <p>
    This project was designed as a practical learning exercise to apply
    <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>,
    <strong>database integration</strong>, and basic
    <strong>data analysis</strong> in a real-world context. It reflects my
    progress as a developer and my focus on writing clear, functional, and
    scalable code. Thanks for taking the time to explore the project. I hope you
    find it useful and informative.
