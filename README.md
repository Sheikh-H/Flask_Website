<h1 align="center">📲 First Flask Website</h1>

<p align="center">
  I participated in the <a href = 'https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python'>30 Days Of Python Course by Asabeneh Yetayeh</a>, and this was what I built by the end of it all.
  While I would describe my skills again as *improving*, this has been a real delight of an experience.
  The web application is designed for an educational institute, allowing users to add students to their database. 
  It was more about learning to use APIs and NoSQL databases than anything. I would say that I will now be focusing more on creating similar web applications.
  As this is not a build hosted on a live platform, because I don't want to have the site and database really being used unless required, you would have to download the files and use them to see its functionalities. 
  <br><br>
  I do advise that you refrain from downloading any content from the web unless you have some anti-virus and other security software to check the files before use.
	<br><br>
	This is the second edition of my website, as I was displeased with my first attempt. Everything was messy and unorganised, which isn't really usual for me.
